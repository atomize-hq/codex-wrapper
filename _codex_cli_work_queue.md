## Work Queue Summary (autogenerated)

- Version: `0.97.0`
- Baseline: `0.92.0`
- Required target: `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
- Primary report: `cli_manifests/codex/reports/0.97.0/coverage.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.json`

### Counts (required target)

- missing_commands: 7 (non-help: 5, help-only: 2)
- missing_flags: 2 (root: 0, non-root: 2)
- missing_args: 5
- unsupported: 0
- intentionally_unsupported (audit-only): 2
- excluded_commands/flags/args (audit-only): 0/1/1

### Notes on inheritance / reporting

- **IU subtree inheritance (ADR 0004):** if the wrapper marks a command path as `intentionally_unsupported`, all descendant commands/flags/args are treated as IU and appear under `deltas.intentionally_unsupported` (not `missing_*`). Override by adding an exact wrapper coverage entry.
- **Global flags model:** some flags are treated as global (root) and are reported at `path=[]` to avoid per-command noise; fix root coverage for global flags. If you see the same flag reported missing under many subcommands, confirm whether it is truly global for that version by inspecting `snapshots/0.97.0/union.json`.
