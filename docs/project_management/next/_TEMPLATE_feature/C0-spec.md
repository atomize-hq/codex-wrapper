# C0-spec – <TRIAD TITLE>

## Scope
- <List explicit behaviors, defaults, error handling, and platform guards.>
- <If filesystem-related: protected paths, exclusions, and safety invariants.>

## Acceptance Criteria
- <Observable outcomes that can be verified by tests or manual steps.>
- <Include “what success looks like” in logs/outputs when relevant.>

## Out of Scope
- <Explicitly list what is not being done in this triad to prevent scope creep.>
