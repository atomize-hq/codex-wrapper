# Substrate Integration Guide (Codex Wrapper)

This guide describes a recommended integration pattern for using the `crates/codex` wrapper inside
Substrate’s async shell/orchestrator. It is Codex-specific but intended to be a template for future
CLI agent wrappers (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.).

## What the wrapper provides

- Live execution + streaming: spawn `codex exec --json` and consume typed `ThreadEvent` values.
- Raw JSONL tee: optionally append each raw JSONL line to a file (`json_event_log`) for replay.
- Offline ingestion: parse a saved JSONL log file back into typed `ThreadEvent` values using the
  same normalization rules as streaming.

Normative contracts:

- Offline parsing API: `docs/specs/codex-thread-event-jsonl-parser-contract.md`
- Offline parsing scenarios: `docs/specs/codex-thread-event-jsonl-parser-scenarios-v1.md`
- Normalization semantics: `crates/codex/JSONL_COMPAT.md`

## Recommended Substrate pattern

### 1) Live run (primary UX)

- Use `CodexClient::stream_exec` / `stream_resume`.
- Configure:
  - `.json(true)` + `.mirror_stdout(false)` so Substrate owns rendering.
  - `.quiet(true)` unless debugging.
  - `.cd(<workspace>)` to pin execution context.
  - `.codex_home(<isolated>)` to avoid mutating a user’s global Codex state.
  - `.json_event_log(<artifact path>)` to tee raw JSONL for replay/debug.

Substrate then maps `ThreadEvent` into its own `AgentEvent` bus for UI and telemetry.

### 2) Offline replay / context extraction

The offline parser is intentionally synchronous and line-oriented. In Substrate (Tokio control
plane), run it in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` (or a dedicated thread) and forward results over an
async channel.

Use the tolerant iterator and decide strictness in Substrate:

- Continue on per-line errors for “best-effort replay”.
- Optionally fail-fast in tools/tests by stopping at the first error.

## Parsing behavior (v1, locked)

These behaviors are shared by streaming normalization and offline parsing:

- Blank / whitespace-only lines are ignored.
- A single trailing `\r` is trimmed (CRLF tolerance); the parser MUST NOT apply full `.trim()`.
- Unknown or unrecognized `type` values surface as per-line parse errors and do not stop parsing.
- Synthetic `turn_id` generation uses a monotonic counter scoped to the parser instance and does
  not reset on new threads within a concatenated log.

## Artifact hygiene (important for Substrate)

Treat raw Codex JSONL logs as sensitive artifacts:

- Store them under a per-session directory (e.g., `~/.substrate/agents/codex/<session_id>/`).
- Do not mirror raw JSONL lines into Substrate’s global trace by default.
- Prefer emitting redacted, high-level summaries into Substrate’s `AgentEvent` stream; keep the full
  detail in the artifact file.
