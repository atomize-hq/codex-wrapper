# ADR 0004: Wrapper Coverage - Intentionally Unsupported (IU) Subtree Inheritance

Date: 2026-01-31
Status: Proposed

## Context

ADR 0002 and ADR 0003 define a deterministic parity system:
- Upstream `codex` surfaces are captured in `cli_manifests/codex/snapshots/<version>/union.json`.
- Wrapper-declared support is captured in `cli_manifests/codex/wrapper_coverage.json`, generated from `crates/codex/src/wrapper_coverage_manifest.rs`.
- `xtask codex-report` produces a deterministic work queue under `cli_manifests/codex/reports/<version>/coverage.*.json`.

The wrapper coverage model supports a per-unit `intentionally_unsupported` coverage level for:
- commands,
- flags, and
- positional args.

The v1 generator contract requires:
- `intentionally_unsupported` units must include a non-empty `note` rationale (validator enforced),
- and the report must remain deterministic and reviewable.

The parity system explicitly excludes TUI-only help-surface units using `cli_manifests/codex/RULES.json.parity_exclusions` (these are reported under `excluded_*`, not `missing_*`).

## Problem

Some upstream CLI surface areas are intentionally not wrapped for product/policy reasons (for example: experimental/setup-time utilities such as `codex cloud ...` and `codex completion ...`).

Today, the parity pipeline requires explicit unit-by-unit enumeration to classify an entire subtree as intentionally unsupported:
- marking a parent command as `intentionally_unsupported` does not automatically classify its descendant commands/flags/args,
- so the reports remain noisy unless we add large, brittle lists of IU entries for every descendant unit.

This increases maintenance cost and makes it harder for the parity pipeline to produce actionable deltas.

## Decision

Introduce deterministic "IU subtree inheritance" as a report-time classification rule.

If the wrapper explicitly marks a command path as `intentionally_unsupported`, then upstream units under that command subtree are classified as `intentionally_unsupported` by inheritance, unless overridden by explicit wrapper declarations.

This decision:
- does not change artifact schemas,
- does not change how upstream snapshots are generated,
- and does not change wrapper coverage generation output shape.

It changes only how `xtask codex-report` (and corresponding validation rules) interpret wrapper coverage when computing deltas.

## Detailed Semantics

### Definitions

- A command path is a list of tokens, `path: []` for root, `path: ["cloud","exec"]` for subcommands, etc.
- An upstream "unit" is one of:
  - command: identified by `path`,
  - flag: identified by `(path, key)`,
  - arg: identified by `(path, name)`.
- A wrapper coverage "explicit declaration" is any wrapper coverage entry that exactly matches the unit identity (including level `explicit|passthrough|unsupported|unknown|intentionally_unsupported`).

### IU Subtree Root

An "IU subtree root" is a wrapper coverage command entry with:
- `level = intentionally_unsupported`, and
- a non-empty `note` rationale.

### Inheritance Rule

For a given upstream unit U with command path `P`:

1. Find the set of IU subtree roots whose `path` is a prefix of `P` (including equality).
2. If there are no matching IU subtree roots, IU inheritance does not apply.
3. If there is at least one matching IU subtree root:
   - Choose the nearest root by longest prefix (max path length).
   - The chosen root's `note` is the inherited IU rationale for U.

### Override Rule (explicit wrapper declarations win)

If the wrapper explicitly declares coverage for U (exact unit identity), then IU inheritance does not apply to U.

This allows:
- treating a namespace command as IU while still supporting a specific descendant,
- and migrating a previously unwrapped subtree into the wrapper gradually without removing the parent IU immediately.

### Reporting Rule (do not suppress)

Inherited IU units remain visible in reports:
- they MUST NOT appear under `missing_commands`, `missing_flags`, or `missing_args`,
- instead they MUST appear under `deltas.intentionally_unsupported` with:
  - `wrapper_level = intentionally_unsupported`, and
  - `note` equal to the inherited IU rationale.

This preserves auditability and makes upstream growth under an intentionally unwrapped subtree visible, while keeping the missing work queue actionable.

### Precedence Order (deterministic)

When classifying an upstream unit:

1. Parity exclusions (TUI policy): if the unit matches `RULES.json.parity_exclusions`, it is reported only under `excluded_*` deltas.
2. Explicit wrapper declaration: if the wrapper coverage explicitly declares the unit, use that level and note.
3. IU subtree inheritance: if the unit is under an IU subtree root and not explicitly declared, classify as inherited IU.
4. Otherwise: classify as missing/unknown/unsupported per existing report rules.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Dramatically reduces the amount of boilerplate required to intentionally waive an entire command family.
- Keeps parity reports actionable (missing lists focus on real wrapper work).
- Preserves visibility into upstream changes under waived subtrees (reported as IU, not hidden).
- Enables incremental adoption: a subtree can remain IU at the top while specific descendants are promoted to explicit support.

### Tradeoffs

- Reports may include large `intentionally_unsupported` lists for waived subtrees. This is acceptable because:
  - it is deterministic,
  - it is audit-friendly,
  - and it avoids polluting `missing_*`.

### Non-goals

- This ADR does not add inheritance of flags/args from intermediate command paths in the upstream snapshot model.
- This ADR does not change the `root_only` positional-args model.
- This ADR does not add wildcard/pattern-based IU declarations.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Require explicit IU enumeration for every unit
   - Rejected: too verbose and brittle for subtree-scale waivers.

2. Suppress inherited IU units entirely from reports
   - Rejected: hides upstream growth and weakens auditability.

3. Add a separate JSON "IU list" outside Rust code
   - Rejected for v1: increases the risk of "turn off parity by config"; keeping IU authored in Rust keeps it closer to wrapper ownership and tests.

## Implementation Notes (non-normative)

Expected changes (to be implemented in a follow-up PR):
- Update `xtask codex-report` to apply IU subtree inheritance and emit derived IU entries under `deltas.intentionally_unsupported`.
- Update `xtask codex-validate` to enforce that inherited IU entries never appear under `missing_*` and that IU notes are present and deterministic.
- Update `cli_manifests/codex/RULES.json` and `cli_manifests/codex/VALIDATOR_SPEC.md` to describe this rule without ambiguity.
- Update `cli_manifests/codex/CI_AGENT_RUNBOOK.md` and `cli_manifests/codex/OPS_PLAYBOOK.md` to reflect the workflow: mark the parent command IU to waive a subtree.
