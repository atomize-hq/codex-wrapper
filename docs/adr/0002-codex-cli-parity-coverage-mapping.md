# ADR 0002: Codex CLI Parity Coverage Mapping (Snapshot → Coverage → Work Queue)

Date: 2026-01-26  
Status: Proposed

## Context

This repository wraps the upstream Codex CLI (`codex`) as a Rust library (`crates/codex`). The upstream CLI changes frequently across:
- commands/subcommands,
- flags/options (global + per-command),
- positional arguments/usage shapes,
- feature-gated surfaces (via `codex features list` and `--enable <FEATURE>`),
- platform-gated surfaces (e.g., `sandbox` variants),
- JSONL event schema and server notifications.

ADR 0001 established the operational workflow to manage drift:
- generate a deterministic CLI snapshot from a specific `codex` binary,
- review diffs as a checklist,
- validate a version via a real-binary test matrix before promoting `latest_validated.txt`.

What is still missing is an automated, *granular* mapping from:
- “what upstream exposes” (commands + flags + positional args) to
- “what the wrapper explicitly supports (and how)”

…so maintainers can produce a clean, structured work queue when a new stable upstream release lands.

### Existing (legacy) inventories

The repo contains older, static inventories used during early planning:
- `capability_manifest.json` (static “supports matrix”, created in the init commit)
- `CLI_MATRIX.md` (static command/flag inventory)

These are useful as historical reference but are not suitable as long-term sources of truth:
- they are not generated deterministically from code or binaries,
- they are not granularly keyed for reliable automated diffs,
- they will drift unless manually maintained.

This ADR defines the replacement system: generated upstream snapshots + generated wrapper coverage + deterministic reports.

## Decision

We will implement a **coverage mapping system** that compares:

1. **Upstream CLI snapshots** (generated from real `codex` binaries, with all features enabled)  
2. A **wrapper coverage manifest** describing what `crates/codex` supports at the command/flag/arg level

…and produces a deterministic **coverage report** that can be converted into triad tasks.

This system is “diff-first” and will avoid network access at crate runtime. Any upstream release discovery/download remains CI/workflow-driven (per ADR 0001).

Critically, the wrapper coverage manifest is not meant to be hand-edited JSON. It must be produced by a deterministic generator (from code and/or wrapper probes) so it can be refreshed by CI/cron with human-in-the-loop gating only.

## Definitions

### Coverage Levels

Each upstream surface is classified as one of:
- `explicit`: first-class API exists in the wrapper (typed request/response or dedicated method).
- `passthrough`: wrapper can drive the surface only via generic argument/override forwarding (weak support).
- `unsupported`: wrapper cannot safely drive the surface today (or we intentionally avoid it).
- `unknown`: not yet assessed (allowed during rollout; treated as work-queue input).

### Surface Units (granular)

The coverage system operates at:
- **Command path**: `["exec","resume"]`, `["sandbox","linux"]`, etc. Root command is `[]`.
- **Flags**: identity key is `long` when present, else `short` (from the upstream snapshot).
- **Positional args**: identity key is `name` (from upstream `Arguments:` and/or `Usage:` inference).

Notes:
- Some upstream help text omits args present in `Usage:`; snapshots infer these and mark them as inferred.
- Some upstream surfaces appear only when enabling feature flags; snapshots record which features were enabled and which commands only appeared when enabled.

## Artifacts

### Upstream Snapshots

We will store versioned upstream snapshots and treat them as generated artifacts:
- `cli_manifests/codex/snapshots/<version>.json` (schema v1; same structure as `current.json`)
- Optional raw help captures for debugging:
  - `cli_manifests/codex/raw_help/<version>/**`

`cli_manifests/codex/current.json` remains the “latest validated snapshot” convenience pointer (or may be replaced by a small pointer file), but the versioned snapshots are the canonical historical inputs for coverage comparisons.

Snapshots must include:
- a root command entry represented as `path: []` so global flags/args are comparable,
- feature probe metadata (what features were enabled during discovery, the `stable|beta|experimental` stage for each feature, and what commands only appeared when enabled).

### Wrapper Capability Snapshot (building block, not a coverage manifest)

`crates/codex` already contains a runtime probe model (`CodexCapabilities`) and an example snapshot generator:
- `cargo run -p codex --example capability_snapshot -- <codex-binary> <out-path> refresh`

This snapshot is useful for wrapper runtime decisions and CI automation (e.g., “what version/features did we actually probe?”), but it is **not** a substitute for `wrapper_coverage.json`:
- it does not enumerate the full command/flag/positional-arg surface area,
- it focuses on “what this binary reports + what probes we ran” rather than “what the wrapper supports”.

We should reuse this capability snapshot as an input to automation (metadata + sanity checks), while keeping the wrapper coverage manifest as a deterministic, generator-produced inventory keyed to upstream `path`/flag/arg identities.

### Wrapper Coverage Manifest

We will maintain a deterministic wrapper coverage manifest, version-controlled:
- `cli_manifests/codex/wrapper_coverage.json`

Schema (v1, conceptual):
- `schema_version` (int)
- `generated_at` (RFC3339, optional)
- `wrapper_version` (string, optional)
- `coverage` (array):
  - `path` (array of strings)
  - `level` (`explicit|passthrough|unsupported|unknown`)
  - `flags` (array, optional):
    - `key` (`--long` or `-s`)
    - `level`
    - `note` (optional)
  - `args` (array, optional):
    - `name`
    - `level`
    - `note` (optional)
  - `note` (optional)

The emitted JSON is the stable comparison input. The source of truth must live near `crates/codex` so it stays aligned with the actual APIs and is refreshed deterministically.

Implementation guidance:
- Prefer generating `wrapper_coverage.json` from code (explicit mapping tables keyed by upstream `path`/flag/arg identity).
- Allow “passthrough” declarations where only generic argument forwarding exists (so the report can highlight candidates for `explicit` promotion).
- Keep narrative notes separate from key identity whenever possible (notes are helpful, but should not churn diffs).

### Coverage Report

The comparer will produce:
- a machine-readable report (`.json`) for automation and task generation, and
- a human-readable report (`.md`) for maintainers.

The report is generated for a pair: `(upstream snapshot version, wrapper coverage manifest)`.

Report sections (conceptual):
- New commands/flags/args in upstream vs wrapper coverage
- Items present but only `passthrough` (candidates for `explicit` promotion)
- Items explicitly marked `unsupported` (intentionally unwrapped) and the policy rationale
- Feature-gated additions (commands that appear only when all features are enabled)

## Operating Workflow

When a new upstream stable release is identified (Release Watch / manual):

1. Generate or download the target binary in CI/workflow (no runtime downloads).
2. Generate an upstream snapshot with all features enabled.
3. Run the coverage comparer against:
   - `min_supported` snapshot,
   - `latest_validated` snapshot,
   - candidate stable snapshot.
4. Use the report to create a triad work queue (code/test/integ) for missing surfaces.
5. Only after integration validations pass on Linux (per ADR 0001) promote:
   - `cli_manifests/codex/latest_validated.txt`
   - `cli_manifests/codex/current.json` (or pointer) to the validated snapshot

## Consequences

### Benefits
- Produces a deterministic, granular “what changed and what we need to support” list.
- Separates “discovery” (upstream snapshot) from “support/coverage” (wrapper manifest) and “validation” (real-binary test matrix).
- Makes feature-gated surfaces explicit and reviewable.

### Tradeoffs / Risks
- The wrapper coverage manifest requires ongoing maintenance.
- Upstream help output is not a perfect source of truth; snapshots are “best available” and should be reconciled with real-binary behavior and fixtures.
- Some surfaces may be intentionally unsupported for safety/policy reasons and must be tracked as such to avoid perpetual churn.

## Follow-ups (out of scope for this ADR)
- JSONL/event-schema parity reporting (separate report stream; likely separate ADR).
- Automatic task creation from reports (allowed later, but human review remains required).
