# Codex ThreadEvent JSONL Parser Contract (v1)

Status: **Normative** (paired with ADR 0005)  
Scope: offline parsing of Codex `--json` JSONL logs into `ThreadEvent`

## Normative language

This document uses RFC 2119-style requirement keywords (`MUST`, `MUST NOT`).
Any change to these requirements requires updating this spec and reviewing ADR 0005.

## Purpose

Define a **zero-ambiguity** public API for parsing Codex CLI JSONL logs into the existing typed
event model (`ThreadEvent`) while **reusing the same normalization semantics** as the streaming
path.

This contract is intentionally scoped to Codex-specific JSONL parsing. Higher-level cross-agent
normalization, analytics, and reporting are out of scope.

## Normative references

- Normalization semantics: `crates/codex/JSONL_COMPAT.md` (authoritative)
- Motivation and scope: `docs/adr/0005-codex-jsonl-log-parser-api.md`

If there is any conflict between ADR 0005 and this contract, this contract takes precedence.

## Public API (v1, normative)

The `codex` crate MUST expose the following items at the crate root (i.e., these paths MUST
resolve for downstream consumers):

```rust
use codex::{
    JsonlThreadEventParser, ThreadEventJsonlFileReader, ThreadEventJsonlReader,
    ThreadEventJsonlRecord, thread_event_jsonl_file, thread_event_jsonl_reader,
};
```

Concretely, the crate MUST make these symbols available as:

- `codex::JsonlThreadEventParser`
- `codex::ThreadEventJsonlRecord`
- `codex::ThreadEventJsonlReader`
- `codex::ThreadEventJsonlFileReader`
- `codex::thread_event_jsonl_reader`
- `codex::thread_event_jsonl_file`

The `codex` crate MUST provide a `codex::jsonl` module containing the following API surface:

```rust
pub mod jsonl {
    use std::io::BufRead;
    use std::path::Path;

    use crate::{CodexError, ExecStreamError, ThreadEvent};

    #[derive(Clone, Debug, Default)]
    pub struct JsonlThreadEventParser { /* private */ }

    impl JsonlThreadEventParser {
        /// Constructs a new parser with no established context.
        pub fn new() -> Self;

        /// Clears any thread/turn context and resets synthetic turn counters.
        pub fn reset(&mut self);

        /// Parses a single logical JSONL line.
        ///
        /// - Returns `Ok(None)` for empty / whitespace-only lines.
        /// - Otherwise returns `Ok(Some(ThreadEvent))` on success.
        /// - Returns `Err(ExecStreamError)` on JSON parse / normalization / typed parse failures.
        pub fn parse_line(&mut self, line: &str) -> Result<Option<ThreadEvent>, ExecStreamError>;
    }

    #[derive(Clone, Debug)]
    pub struct ThreadEventJsonlRecord {
        /// 1-based line number in the underlying source (file/reader).
        pub line_number: usize,
        /// The parse outcome for this line (success or failure).
        pub outcome: Result<ThreadEvent, ExecStreamError>,
    }

    pub struct ThreadEventJsonlReader<R: BufRead> { /* private */ }

    impl<R: BufRead> ThreadEventJsonlReader<R> {
        /// Creates a reader-backed iterator with a fresh parser.
        pub fn new(reader: R) -> Self;

        /// Consumes the iterator and returns the wrapped reader.
        pub fn into_inner(self) -> R;
    }

    impl<R: BufRead> Iterator for ThreadEventJsonlReader<R> {
        type Item = ThreadEventJsonlRecord;
    }

    pub type ThreadEventJsonlFileReader =
        ThreadEventJsonlReader<std::io::BufReader<std::fs::File>>;

    /// Convenience constructor for reader-backed parsing.
    pub fn thread_event_jsonl_reader<R: BufRead>(reader: R) -> ThreadEventJsonlReader<R>;

    /// Convenience constructor for file-backed parsing.
    ///
    /// This function MUST:
    /// - open the file at `path`,
    /// - wrap it in `std::io::BufReader`,
    /// - return a `ThreadEventJsonlFileReader`.
    ///
    /// I/O failures (open errors) MUST be surfaced as
    /// `Err(ExecStreamError::Codex(CodexError::CaptureIo(io_err)))`.
    pub fn thread_event_jsonl_file(
        path: impl AsRef<Path>,
    ) -> Result<ThreadEventJsonlFileReader, ExecStreamError>;
}
```

### Async I/O (v1 decision)

v1 MUST be synchronous (`std::io::BufRead`) to keep the API small and deterministic.
Async reader support (e.g., `tokio::io::AsyncBufRead`) is explicitly deferred to a future v2/vNext
contract if needed.

## Parsing semantics (normative)

### Line normalization

Before attempting JSON parsing, the parser MUST apply the same line-handling rules as
`crates/codex/JSONL_COMPAT.md`:

- Empty / whitespace-only lines MUST be ignored.
- A single trailing `\r` MUST be trimmed (CRLF tolerance).

The `JsonlThreadEventParser::parse_line` method MUST implement this behavior and return `Ok(None)`
for ignored lines.

The parser MUST NOT apply a full `.trim()` before JSON parsing.

### Event normalization and context inference

For non-empty lines, the parser MUST apply the event normalization rules defined in
`crates/codex/JSONL_COMPAT.md` (including event type aliases, item envelope normalization, field
aliases, and context inference).

The offline parsing API MUST match the streaming normalization behavior:

- Context is maintained across lines (thread/turn inference).
- Observing `thread.started` or `thread.resumed` MUST reset current turn context (per
  `crates/codex/JSONL_COMPAT.md`).
- Errors MUST be per-line and MUST NOT prevent parsing of later lines.

### Iterator behavior

`ThreadEventJsonlReader<R>` MUST:

- Read lines from the underlying `BufRead` source in order.
- Maintain a 1-based physical line counter.
- For each physical line:
  - If the line is empty/whitespace-only (after trimming `\r`), it MUST advance the line counter and
    emit no record for that line.
  - Otherwise, it MUST emit exactly one `ThreadEventJsonlRecord` with:
    - `line_number` set to the physical line number, and
    - `outcome` set to the parse result for that line.

Note: This makes `line_number` values potentially non-contiguous in the emitted record stream when
the input contains blank lines. This is intentional and is part of the contract.

## Data minimization (v1, normative)

To keep the parsing surface safe-by-default and lightweight:

- `ThreadEventJsonlRecord` MUST NOT include the raw JSONL line on success (no `raw_line` field).
- On failure, the error value SHOULD retain the original line content when possible (existing
  `ExecStreamError` variants already carry `line` for parse/normalize failures).

If a downstream tool needs a “raw log viewer”, it should read the file directly or wrap the reader
to retain raw lines locally, rather than expanding the wrapper’s core parsing record.

## Stability and compatibility guarantees (normative)

- The offline parser MUST reuse the same normalization behavior as streaming; drift between the two
  is a bug.
- Accepting new upstream JSON shapes SHOULD be handled by extending normalization and/or adding
  aliases rather than breaking signatures.
- Breaking changes to this public API require a semver-major bump of the `codex` crate.

## Strict mode (v1 decision)

v1 intentionally provides a tolerant, per-line outcome stream only.

- The wrapper MUST NOT provide separate “strict mode” helpers in v1 (e.g., `*_strict` constructors
  that stop on the first error or return only `Result<ThreadEvent, _>` without line numbers).
- If strict helpers are added in the future, they require a contract update and MUST remain
  expressible as a deterministic wrapper around the tolerant iterator.
