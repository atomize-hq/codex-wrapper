+##### P1.19 — Seam extraction: move `lib.rs` unit/integration-style tests into `crates/codex/src/tests.rs` (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Reduce `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` size by moving the large `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block into an out-of-line module file (`crates/codex/src/tests.rs`) while keeping test behavior identical.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (replace the inline test module with `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`)
+  - `crates/codex/src/tests.rs` (new; contains the moved test module content)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (tests-only move).
+  - Move is mechanical: no test logic edits beyond import/path fixes required by the move.
+- Risk: Low–Medium (test compilation visibility/import churn; keep move mechanical).
+- Rollback: Move the test module back into `lib.rs`.

+##### P1.20 — Seam extraction: core `CodexClient` command runner helpers into `client_core.rs` (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Reduce `lib.rs` size by moving the “core runner” implementation details (e.g., `run_basic_command`, `run_simple_command_with_overrides`, working dir context helpers) into a dedicated internal module while keeping `CodexClient`’s public API and behavior unchanged.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod client_core;` and keep a small façade `impl CodexClient` surface)
+  - `crates/codex/src/client_core.rs` (new; `impl CodexClient { ... }` blocks + private helpers)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No externally observable behavior changes (pure move; tests pass).
+  - No public API path changes.
+  - New file meets §7.3 size policy (split if it grows beyond 600 LOC).
+- Risk: Medium (subtle behavior changes if refactoring instead of moving; keep edits purely mechanical).
+- Rollback: Revert module move; restore the original implementations in `lib.rs`.

+##### P1.21 — Seam extraction: `CodexError` and shared “defaults” helpers into dedicated modules (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Move `CodexError` and small crate-root helper functions/constants (e.g., default env/binary path helpers) out of `lib.rs` into cohesive modules to reduce façade size, while preserving `codex::CodexError` and all other public item paths via re-exports.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire new modules + `pub use` re-exports)
+  - `crates/codex/src/error.rs` (new; `CodexError` definition)
+  - `crates/codex/src/defaults.rs` (new; small helpers/constants as appropriate)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (`codex::CodexError` and any public helpers remain available at the same paths).
+  - Move is mechanical: error variants/messages and helper semantics unchanged (tests pass).
+  - New files meet §7.3 size policy.
+- Risk: Low–Medium (import/visibility churn; keep move mechanical).
+- Rollback: Revert module move; restore original definitions in `lib.rs`.

+##### P1.22 — Seam extraction: remaining `CodexClient` non-streaming wrapper methods into `commands/*` follow-ups (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Finish draining `lib.rs` of the remaining non-streaming `CodexClient` wrapper methods still implemented in the crate root (e.g., `features`, `help`, `review`, `exec_review`, `fork_session`, `cloud_*`), by moving them into additional `crates/codex/src/commands/*` modules as `impl CodexClient` blocks.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (remove moved method bodies; keep façade + re-exports stable)
+  - `crates/codex/src/commands/` (add new file(s) as needed, split by subcommand/domain)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (methods remain on `CodexClient`; signatures unchanged).
+  - Move is mechanical: CLI args/env/output handling unchanged (tests pass).
+  - New files meet §7.3 size policy.
+- Risk: Medium (many small flows; keep moves grouped by subcommand domain and avoid opportunistic edits).
+- Rollback: Revert module moves; restore method bodies in `lib.rs`.

+##### P1.23 — Refresh Phase 1 size evidence and (if eligible) close Phase 1 (no code moves)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: After P1.19–P1.22 land, re-measure `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` size/top offenders and update §3.2/Phase 1 status so the workplan reflects the actual post-extraction state.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `refactor_workplan.md` (this file): update §3.2 top-offenders evidence reference(s) and Phase 1 status/reason if `lib.rs` is now below the ceiling.
+  - `evidence_runs/YYYY-MM-DD/` (new measurement outputs, e.g., tokei + sorted list)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - Measurement evidence is captured and cited via file paths.
+  - Phase 1 status is updated only if the evidence supports it (no subjective “looks good”).
+  - No behavior changes (planning/measurement only).
+- Risk: Low.
+- Rollback: N/A.

 - `cli/*` request/response models depend on builder override types (`CliOverridesPatch`, `FeatureToggles`, `ConfigOverride`), so schedule after P1.7 stabilized the builder module tree (done in P1.11).
 - `process.rs` should land before moving additional `CodexClient` impl blocks so spawn/stdio helpers have a single home and are not duplicated across modules.
 - `exec/*` should focus on `codex exec` streaming + resume surfaces; keep other subcommands (apply/diff, sandbox, app-server generate) out of scope to keep the PR-sized.

+### 2026-02-05 — P1.18 Plan next Phase 1 seams after P1.17 (no code moves)
+
+- Scope/step: P1.18
+- Why: `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` still contains significant bulk after P1.14–P1.17 (notably a large `#[cfg(test)]` test module and additional `CodexClient` wrapper methods); plan the next PR-sized extractions while keeping public API paths stable.
+- What changed:
+  - Updated §7.1 seam extraction order to reflect the current module layout and added the next extraction seams.
+  - Updated §10 “Next 5 Tasks” to remove already-done items and queue the next Phase 1 steps.
+  - Added new Phase 1 checklist items (P1.19–P1.23) to capture the next PR-sized extractions and Phase 1 evidence refresh.
