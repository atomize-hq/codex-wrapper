+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [x] Done  
+Last Updated: 2026-02-05
+
+- Goal: Reduce `crates/codex/src/builder.rs` size by splitting it into a cohesive `crates/codex/src/builder/*` module tree while preserving existing public API paths via re-exports from `crates/codex/src/lib.rs`.
+- Expected files touched:

+  - `crates/codex/src/builder.rs` (move to module tree)
+  - `crates/codex/src/builder/` (new file(s))
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.

+- Goal: Update Phase 1 seam plan for the remaining `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` “god module” content after P1.7, identifying the next 2–4 PR-sized seams while preserving public API paths.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `refactor_workplan.md` (this file): update §7.1 and §10 queue with the next concrete seam steps.
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - Next seams are listed in §7.1 with clear boundaries and extraction order.
+  - Each planned extraction is PR-sized and reversible; size-policy expectations are noted (§7.3).
+  - No behavior changes (planning only).
+- Risk: Low.
+- Rollback: N/A (planning-only change).

+- Goal: Extract bundled binary resolution types + helpers (`BundledBinarySpec`, `BundledBinary`, `BundledBinaryError`, `resolve_bundled_binary`, `default_bundled_platform_label`) into `crates/codex/src/bundled_binary.rs`, preserving existing public API paths via re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+- Expected files touched:

+  - No public API path changes (façade + re-exports).
+  - Serde shapes remain identical (pure move; no field/tag renames; tests pass).
+  - New module meets §7.3 size policy (likely > soft; must stay ≤ 600 or be split into `events/*` if it grows).
+- Risk: Medium (serialization/type visibility churn; keep move mechanical).
+- Rollback: Revert module move + re-exports; restore original event model definitions in `lib.rs`.
+

+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [x] Done

+- Goal: Extract request/response model structs for non-streaming CLI subcommands into a cohesive `crates/codex/src/cli/*` module tree (e.g., features/help/review/resume/fork/cloud/app-server and `codex mcp` command request types), preserving existing public API paths via re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+  - Naming note: keep this distinct from the `mcp/*` runtime module tree; this seam is about *invoking CLI subcommands*, not the internal MCP client/runtime implementation.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod cli;` + `pub use ...`; remove moved items)
+  - `crates/codex/src/cli/mod.rs` (new)

+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (façade + re-exports).
+  - New files meet §7.3 size policy (target ≤ 300 LOC each; must stay ≤ 600).
+  - Step is “models-only” unless a small amount of wiring is necessary to keep the wrapper compiling (avoid moving execution logic in the same PR).
+- Risk: Medium (large move surface; keep extraction mechanical and domain-split).

+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (façade + re-exports).
+  - Parsing behavior remains unchanged (pure move; tests pass).

+- Expected files touched:
+  - `refactor_workplan.md` (this file): update §7.1 and §10 queue with the next concrete seam steps.
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - Updated seam list in §7.1 reflects the then-current module layout and identifies the next 2–4 PR-sized extractions.

+##### P1.14 — Seam extraction: spawn/process plumbing (`process.rs`) (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [x] Done  
+Last Updated: 2026-02-05
+
+- Goal: Extract the internal, cross-cutting subprocess spawning + stdio handling helpers from `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` into `crates/codex/src/process.rs` (or `process/*` if it grows), preserving public APIs by keeping these helpers private to the crate (or re-exporting only if already publicly reachable).
+- Candidate contents (keep cohesive; move mechanically):
+  - `spawn_with_retry` + spawn error classification.
+  - stdout/stderr tee helpers (console mirroring, buffering, “quiet” handling) and shared IO utilities used by exec/apply/diff/sandbox/proxy flows.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod process;`; update internal call sites)
+  - `crates/codex/src/process.rs` (new) or `crates/codex/src/process/*` (new)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (helpers remain crate-private unless already exposed).
+  - New file(s) meet §7.3 size policy (target ≤ 300 LOC; must stay ≤ 600 unless intentionally split).
+- Risk: Medium (cross-cutting; many call sites). Keep changes purely mechanical and avoid behavior edits.
+- Rollback: Revert module move; restore helpers in `lib.rs`.
+
+##### P1.15 — Seam extraction: exec streaming + resume types + helpers (`exec/*`) (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Extract remaining exec/streaming surface area still defined in `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` into a cohesive `crates/codex/src/exec/*` module tree (or a single `exec.rs` first), preserving crate-root public API paths via `pub use` re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+- Scope (targeted; avoid bundling unrelated subcommands):
+  - Public types currently in `lib.rs`: `ExecStreamRequest`, `ResumeSelector`, `ResumeRequest`, `ExecStream`, `ExecCompletion`, `ExecStreamError`.
+  - `CodexClient` methods: `send_prompt*`, `stream_exec*`, resume helpers, and any private helpers that are exec-stream specific (JSONL framing already lives in `jsonl.rs`; event models already live in `events.rs`).
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod exec;` or `mod exec { ... }` via `mod exec;` + re-exports; remove moved items)
+  - `crates/codex/src/exec.rs` or `crates/codex/src/exec/*` (new)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (all moved public types remain available at their existing `codex::*` paths).
+  - Move is mechanical: serde shapes, streaming semantics, and buffering/backpressure behavior unchanged (tests pass).
+  - New files meet §7.3 size policy (split by domain if needed to stay ≤ 600 LOC).
+- Dependencies / ordering:
+  - Do after P1.14 so spawn/stdio helpers can be shared cleanly.
+- Risk: Medium (streaming correctness; move-only mitigates).
+- Rollback: Revert module move; restore original `lib.rs` definitions.
+
+##### P1.16 — Seam extraction: auth/login helpers (`auth.rs`) (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Move authentication state + login flow helpers out of `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` into `crates/codex/src/auth.rs`, preserving existing public API paths via re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+- Scope:
+  - `AuthSessionHelper` + related public enums: `CodexAuthStatus`, `CodexAuthMethod`, `CodexLogoutStatus`.
+  - `CodexClient` login-related helpers (spawn/login status helpers) that are not exec-stream specific.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod auth;` + re-exports; remove moved items)
+  - `crates/codex/src/auth.rs` (new)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes.
+  - Login process invocation semantics unchanged (pure move; tests pass).
+  - New module meets §7.3 size policy.
+- Dependencies / ordering:
+  - Prefer after P1.14 so any shared spawn/stdio helpers can be referenced from a single internal module.
+- Risk: Low–Medium (process spawn plumbing; keep move mechanical).
+- Rollback: Revert module move + re-exports; restore original definitions in `lib.rs`.

+##### P1.17 — Seam extraction: remaining client subcommand wrappers (`commands/*`) (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Extract the remaining `CodexClient` subcommand wrapper methods still implemented in `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` into a cohesive `crates/codex/src/commands/*` module tree while preserving public API paths and avoiding large cross-cutting moves.
+- Scope (PR-sized; split by domain if needed):
+  - `CodexClient::apply` / `CodexClient::diff` method implementations (types already live in `apply_diff.rs`).
+  - `CodexClient::generate_app_server_bindings` (app-server generate helpers).
+  - `CodexClient::list_features` (execution wrapper; parsing is in `version.rs`).
+  - `CodexClient::start_responses_api_proxy`, `CodexClient::stdio_to_uds`, `CodexClient::run_sandbox`.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod commands;` + `mod sandbox;`/`mod responses_api_proxy;` if split; keep façade stable)
+  - `crates/codex/src/commands/` (new file(s))
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (methods remain on `CodexClient`; any public helper types remain available at existing `codex::*` paths).
+  - Changes are mechanical: command flags/env, stdout/stderr mirroring, and exit-status handling unchanged.
+  - New file(s) meet §7.3 size policy.
+- Dependencies / ordering:
+  - Prefer after P1.14 so shared spawn/stdio helpers live in one place.
+- Risk: Medium (many flows; keep each move small and consider splitting this step into two PRs if it grows).
+- Rollback: Revert module move(s); restore original method bodies in `lib.rs`.

 Notes / dependencies:
 - `capabilities.rs` is used by the builder/client for cache policies, overrides, and probes; extract before apply/diff to reduce cross-cutting churn.
 - `apply_diff.rs` depends on command execution plumbing but should remain API-stable via re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+- `bundled_binary.rs` is leaf-ish and can move early to reduce `lib.rs` churn (it is used mainly by the builder and docs).
+- `events.rs` is a dependency of streaming exec/resume types; extract it before moving execution/stream implementation blocks.
+- `cli/*` request/response models depend on builder override types (`CliOverridesPatch`, `FeatureToggles`, `ConfigOverride`), so schedule after P1.7 stabilized the builder module tree (done in P1.11).
+- `process.rs` should land before moving additional `CodexClient` impl blocks so spawn/stdio helpers have a single home and are not duplicated across modules.
+- `exec/*` should focus on `codex exec` streaming + resume surfaces; keep other subcommands (apply/diff, sandbox, app-server generate) out of scope to keep the PR-sized.

+- Scope/step: P1.7
+- Why: Bring `crates/codex/src/builder.rs` below the size ceiling by splitting into a cohesive `crates/codex/src/builder/*` module tree while preserving public API paths via re-exports from `crates/codex/src/lib.rs`.
+- What changed:
+  - Converted `crates/codex/src/builder.rs` into `crates/codex/src/builder/{mod.rs,types.rs,cli_overrides.rs}`.
+  - Preserved stable public API paths (e.g., `codex::CodexClientBuilder`, `codex::CliOverrides`, `codex::ColorMode`) via existing `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` re-exports.

+- What changed:
+  - Moved `BundledBinarySpec`, `BundledBinary`, `BundledBinaryError`, `resolve_bundled_binary`, and `default_bundled_platform_label` into `crates/codex/src/bundled_binary.rs`.

+- Why: Reduce `lib.rs` bulk by extracting the JSONL event envelope + payload models emitted by `codex exec --json` into a dedicated module, while preserving crate-root public API via re-exports.
+- What changed:
+  - Moved JSONL event models (`ThreadEvent`, `ItemEnvelope`, `ItemPayload`, deltas/states/status enums, and `EventError`) from `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` into `crates/codex/src/events.rs` with identical serde shapes (mechanical move).

+
+- Scope/step: P1.12
+- Why: Correct failed gates from the initial P1.12 run (rustfmt diffs, E0364 visibility error, and advisory DB read-only lock failures).
+- Fixes applied:
+  - Made `version::update_advisory_from_capabilities` `pub` so the existing crate-root re-export (`codex::update_advisory_from_capabilities`) compiles without changing the public API path.
+  - Re-applied `cargo fmt --all` to eliminate rustfmt diffs.
+  - Reran `cargo audit` / `cargo deny` with a writable `CARGO_HOME` under `/tmp` (seeded from `/home/dev/.cargo`) plus offline/no-fetch flags to avoid read-only advisory DB locks.

+- Why: Refresh Phase 1 seam planning after P1.9–P1.12 so the remaining `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` bulk can be extracted in PR-sized, API-stable steps aligned with the current module layout.
+- What changed:
+  - Updated §7.1 seam extraction order to reflect the current module layout after P1.9–P1.12 and to queue the next 2–4 PR-sized extractions (process plumbing, exec streaming, auth/login, and remaining subcommand wrappers).

-1) P1.6 — Seam extraction: JSONL streaming/framing (`jsonl.rs`) (API preserved)
-2) P2.6 — Move high-level MCP clients into `mcp/client.rs` (API preserved)
-3) P2.7 — Reduce `mcp.rs` below program ceiling (remaining coordinator split) (API preserved)
-4) P3.9 — Reduce `codex_validate.rs` below ceiling (follow-on split) with deterministic output preserved
-5) (TBD) Next Phase 1 seam extraction after P1.6
+1) P1.15 — Seam extraction: exec streaming + resume types + helpers (`exec/*`) (API preserved)
+2) P1.16 — Seam extraction: auth/login helpers (`auth.rs`) (API preserved)
+3) P1.17 — Seam extraction: remaining client subcommand wrappers (`commands/*`) (API preserved)
+4) P1.18 — Plan next Phase 1 seams after P1.17 (no code moves)
