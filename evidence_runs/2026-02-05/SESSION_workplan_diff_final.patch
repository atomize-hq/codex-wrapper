+### 2026-02-05 — P4.0.5 tests modularization follow-up (`cli` domain split 5/5)
+
+- Scope/step: P4.0.5
+- Why: Continue the P4.0 loop by moving the remaining CLI-domain tests into a dedicated module and removing the transitional `cli_commands` module.
+- What changed:
+  - Moved the remaining CLI-domain tests from `crates/codex/src/tests/cli_commands.rs` into `crates/codex/src/tests/cli.rs` with test names/assertions preserved.
+  - Updated `crates/codex/src/tests/mod.rs` wiring from `mod cli_commands;` to `mod cli;`.
+  - Removed `crates/codex/src/tests/cli_commands.rs`.
+  - Kept shared helpers in `crates/codex/src/tests/support.rs`; no helper behavior changes were required.
+- Validation results (§4.1):
+  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_fmt_check.txt`)
+  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_clippy.txt`)
+  - `cargo test --all-targets --all-features`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_test.txt`)
+  - `cargo audit`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_audit_after.txt`) (initial FAIL: `evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_audit.txt`; reran with writable temp `CARGO_HOME` and `--no-fetch --stale` due advisory DB lock/network constraints in this sandbox)
+  - `cargo deny check advisories`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_deny_advisories_after.txt`) (initial FAIL: `evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_deny_advisories.txt`; reran with writable temp `CARGO_HOME`, offline mode, and `--disable-fetch` due advisory DB lock constraints in this sandbox)
+  - `cargo deny check licenses`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_deny_licenses.txt`)
+  - Final `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P4.0.5_cargo_fmt_check_final.txt`)
