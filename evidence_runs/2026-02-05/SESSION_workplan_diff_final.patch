+### 2026-02-05 — Extract builder/config/flags surfaces
+
+- Scope/step: P1.5
+- Why: Reduce `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` size by extracting the builder/config/flags surface into a cohesive module while preserving public API paths.
+- What changed:
+  - Moved `CodexClientBuilder` + builder/config/flags enums/structs and CLI override argument construction helpers into `crates/codex/src/builder.rs`.
+  - Preserved existing public API paths via re-exports from `crates/codex/src/lib.rs`.
+- Validation results (§4.1):
+  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P1.5_cargo_fmt_check_final.txt`)
+  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P1.5_cargo_clippy.txt`)
+  - `cargo test --all-targets --all-features`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P1.5_cargo_test.txt`)
+  - `cargo audit`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P1.5_cargo_audit.txt`)
+  - `cargo deny check advisories`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P1.5_cargo_deny_advisories.txt`)
+  - `cargo deny check licenses`: PASS (`evidence_runs/2026-02-05/P1.5_cargo_deny_licenses.txt`)
+- Evidence/patches:
+  - Code diff: `evidence_runs/2026-02-05/SESSION_code_diff_final.patch`
+  - Workplan diff: `evidence_runs/2026-02-05/SESSION_workplan_diff_final.patch`

 | Post-plan work request: “complete next 5 tasks” vs remaining checklist items | 2026-02-04 | Accepted | Workplan needed additional scope to reflect remaining seams beyond P3.5 | Added P1.4 (execpolicy seam), P2.5 (JSON-RPC transport), and P3.6–P3.8 (deeper xtask splits) as Not Started follow-ons. |
 | Legacy combined commit for multiple steps (P1.4/P2.5/P3.6) | 2026-02-05 | Accepted | These steps landed before the “one step = one commit” orchestrator rule was enforced | Commit `2d17281b8d09c7797cd555d4b2fd5951af75b328` contains P1.4 + P2.5 + P3.6 changes; journal entries cite it for provenance.

 | Execution evidence storage policy (`evidence_runs/YYYY-MM-DD/`); keep `audit_pack/execution/*` legacy | 2026-02-04 | Accepted | Provenance clarity: separate immutable audit snapshot (`audit_pack/`) from ongoing execution runs | Store new evidence under `evidence_runs/…` with stable filenames (§8.1). Do not move/delete existing `audit_pack/execution/…` evidence; continue citing it where already referenced. |
+| P1.5 size exception: `builder.rs` > 600 LOC | 2026-02-05 | Accepted | Keep builder/config/flags surfaces cohesive during seam extraction to avoid churn across call sites; follow-up split can happen once the façade boundaries stabilize | `crates/codex/src/builder.rs` is ~921 LOC (above §7.3 hard=600). Follow-up: split into `builder/overrides.rs` + `builder/types.rs` + `builder/mod.rs` once P1.6 lands, preserving re-exports. |
