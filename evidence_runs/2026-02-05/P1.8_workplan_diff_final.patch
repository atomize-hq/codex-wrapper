+##### P1.9 — Seam extraction: bundled binary resolver (`bundled_binary.rs`) (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Extract bundled binary resolution types + helpers (`BundledBinarySpec`, `BundledBinary`, `BundledBinaryError`, `resolve_bundled_binary`, `default_bundled_platform_label`) into `crates/codex/src/bundled_binary.rs`, preserving existing public API paths via re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod bundled_binary;` + `pub use ...`; remove moved items)
+  - `crates/codex/src/bundled_binary.rs` (new)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (façade + re-exports).
+  - New module meets §7.3 size policy (target ≤ 300 LOC; may exceed soft if cohesive but must stay ≤ 600).
+- Risk: Low (leaf-ish extraction; minimal call site churn).
+- Rollback: Revert module move + re-exports; restore original definitions in `lib.rs`.
+
+##### P1.10 — Seam extraction: exec JSONL event models (`events.rs`) (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Extract JSONL event envelope + payload models emitted by `codex exec --json` into `crates/codex/src/events.rs`, preserving existing public API paths via re-exports from `lib.rs` (e.g., `ThreadEvent`, `ItemEnvelope`, `ItemPayload`, delta/state structs, statuses).
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod events;` + `pub use ...`; remove moved items)
+  - `crates/codex/src/events.rs` (new)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (façade + re-exports).
+  - Serde shapes remain identical (pure move; no field/tag renames; tests pass).
+  - New module meets §7.3 size policy (likely > soft; must stay ≤ 600 or be split into `events/*` if it grows).
+- Risk: Medium (serialization/type visibility churn; keep move mechanical).
+- Rollback: Revert module move + re-exports; restore original event model definitions in `lib.rs`.
+
+##### P1.11 — Seam extraction: CLI subcommand request/response models (`cli/*`) (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Extract request/response model structs for non-streaming CLI subcommands into a cohesive `crates/codex/src/cli/*` module tree (e.g., features/help/review/resume/fork/cloud/app-server and `codex mcp` command request types), preserving existing public API paths via re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+  - Naming note: keep this distinct from the `mcp/*` runtime module tree; this seam is about *invoking CLI subcommands*, not the internal MCP client/runtime implementation.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod cli;` + `pub use ...`; remove moved items)
+  - `crates/codex/src/cli/mod.rs` (new)
+  - `crates/codex/src/cli/*.rs` (new; split by domain to satisfy §7.3)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (façade + re-exports).
+  - New files meet §7.3 size policy (target ≤ 300 LOC each; must stay ≤ 600).
+  - Step is “models-only” unless a small amount of wiring is necessary to keep the wrapper compiling (avoid moving execution logic in the same PR).
+- Risk: Medium (large move surface; keep extraction mechanical and domain-split).
+- Rollback: Revert module tree move + re-exports; restore original model structs in `lib.rs`.
+
+##### P1.12 — Seam extraction: feature/version parsing + update advisory helpers (`version.rs`) (API preserved)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: Extract internal parsing/helpers around `codex --version` / `codex help` / `codex features list` probes (semver/channel parsing, commit hash extraction, feature-flag parsing, and update advisory helpers) into `crates/codex/src/version.rs`, preserving existing public API paths for any public helpers (e.g., `update_advisory_from_capabilities`) via re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` (wire `mod version;` + `pub use ...`; remove moved items)
+  - `crates/codex/src/version.rs` (new)
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - All §4.1 gates pass.
+  - No public API path changes (façade + re-exports).
+  - Parsing behavior remains unchanged (pure move; tests pass).
+  - New module meets §7.3 size policy (target ≤ 300 LOC; may exceed soft if cohesive but must stay ≤ 600).
+- Risk: Low–Medium (behavioral regression possible if parsing logic is accidentally edited; keep move mechanical).
+- Rollback: Revert module move + re-exports; restore original helper functions in `lib.rs`.
+
+##### P1.13 — Plan remaining Phase 1 seams after P1.12 (no code moves)
+
+Status: [ ] Not Started  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Done  
+Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
+
+- Goal: After P1.9–P1.12 land, refresh the Phase 1 seam plan based on the then-current `crates/codex/src/lib.rs` structure and remaining top offenders, keeping extraction steps PR-sized and API-stable.
+- Expected files touched:
+  - `refactor_workplan.md` (this file): update §7.1 and §10 queue with the next concrete seam steps.
+- Acceptance criteria (“done when”):
+  - Updated seam list in §7.1 reflects the then-current module layout and identifies the next 2–4 PR-sized extractions.
+  - No behavior changes (planning only).
+- Risk: Low.
+- Rollback: N/A (planning-only change).

 #### Phase 2 — Split `crates/codex/src/mcp.rs` into `crates/codex/src/mcp/*` (API stable)

 4) Execpolicy modeling + parsing → `execpolicy.rs` (P1.4).
 5) Builder/config/flags surfaces → one or more cohesive modules (P1.5; define concrete module(s) when scheduled).

 Notes / dependencies:
 - `capabilities.rs` is used by the builder/client for cache policies, overrides, and probes; extract before apply/diff to reduce cross-cutting churn.
 - `apply_diff.rs` depends on command execution plumbing but should remain API-stable via re-exports from `lib.rs`.
+- `bundled_binary.rs` is leaf-ish and can move early to reduce `lib.rs` churn (it is used mainly by the builder and docs).
+- `events.rs` is a dependency of streaming exec/resume types; extract it before moving execution/stream implementation blocks.
+- `cli/*` request/response models depend on builder override types (`CliOverridesPatch`, `FeatureToggles`, `ConfigOverride`), so schedule after P1.7 stabilized the builder module tree.
