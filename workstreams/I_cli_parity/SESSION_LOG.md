# Session Log — Workstream I (CLI Parity)

Instructions: Append a new entry per session. Include start/end UTC timestamps, agent, task ID(s), summary of changes, branch/worktree refs, tests run. Close with outcomes/blockers. At task completion, write the kickoff prompt for the next task in this workstream branch (not in a worktree).
